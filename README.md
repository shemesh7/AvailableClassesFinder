# Currently the project is not finished because the shoham website removed the room from the course info

# AvailableClassesFinder
A Python script that checks all of the courses that takes place at a certain time and returns a list of available classes where you can study quietly!

# The idea:
The Bar Ilan Shoham website has a list of all the courses that are taking place on a certain day and time. If you open the course, you can see in which class it is being taught.

Given a day and time, the program will open the Shoham website, check all the courses that are currently taking place, and return a list (a list of lists... Firstly the buildings, then the classes) of all the classes that are available at that time in the area of the CS building in Bar Ilan University.
